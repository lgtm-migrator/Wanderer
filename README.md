# StarshipWanderer

The goal of this project is to create a game in which you wander a city sized starship interacting with the inhabitants and generally getting up to trouble.  The following goals are intended for the project:

1. Any action the Player can do Non Player Characters can do
2. Persuasion and Cunning should be as viable as Fighting
3. No dice rolls for actions (if you have Fight 10 and you fight someone with Fight 15 the outcome should always be the same)

Imagine pulling a grenade pin and persuading an npc to pick it up only for him to give it back to you on his round.  Or an opportunistic Worker picking up a dropped item from a killed guard:

**The game is in very early development and not really ready for playing.  Open issues for suggestions or if you like the idea and what to get involved.**
